## Responsibilities

Engineering builds and maintains multiple platforms across the Pantheon infrastructure to achieve the goal of being the most scalable and cost effective Site Hosting organization in the industry

- Ensure that Guardian's internal and external customers have immediate access to the most up to date CMS enabling tools
- Maximize website and infrastructure uptimes
- APIs​, tools, feature access and availability
- Documentation, both simlified and technical
- Manual "Service Requests" as part of the engineering service/triage process​
- User management tooling​
- Auth0​ and Security
- Data integrity / correctness​
- Bug / triage management​
- Helping compliance

## Vision

## Strategy

## Culture & Communication

## Communiations and Triage

### Slack

This is our primary form of communications

#### External

Async chat based commuincation with external customers - paying, free, and prospective.  This is maintained by Customer Support Engineers (CSE)

#### Etiquette

- When discussing a post please respond use "Reply in Thread" so we don't lose messages!
- Be mindful of other people's working hours when `@`-ing them.
  - If it is not mission critical - Feel free to put a `(For Tomorrow)` tag in front of the message.

#### Major channels

In addition to the following shared channels you'll also have a channel for your team. You can find that on [your team's details](#people)

- announcements
- general
- jira-champions
- pantheor-props
- webops

### GitHub Pull Requests

Changes to our services---and this handbook!---must be done using a Pull Request to the appropriate repo.

### Guilds

Engineering hosts a number of targeted discussion groups --"guilds"-- around specific topics areas we are interested in.

#### Data Guild

**Status**: Active
**Head**: XX
**Meetings**: Every X at X:XXPM ET
**Channel**: [#guild-data](#)

##### Mission

Foster better practices around how our data is stored, processed, and viewed.


#### Design Guild
#### Standards Guild

**Status**: Active
**Head**: XX
**Meetings**: Every other X at XPM ET
**Channel**: [#guild-standards](#)

##### Mission

- Codifying and implementing norms, and seeking feedback
- The topics are _not_ bound to Engineering only and may involve other interested parties in the organization
- These should:
  - Start from a High Level where we agree
  - Be Unambiguous
  - Prioritize outcomes over specifics
  - Strive to only break industry standards when we really need to
  - Help Defining Engineering and Operational Terminology

#### Testing Guild

**Status**: Active
**Head**: XX
**Meetings**: Every other XX at 1PM ET
**Channel**: [#guild-testing](#)
##### Mission

Enabling the organization to apply testing best practices and tooling to all aspects on our SDLC.

#### Creating a new guild

Guilds are self-governing, cross-team groups formed to foster standards, knowledge sharing and improve outcomes in specific areas that are germane to the technical development of the product(s). (Interest group that is trying to improve something.)

This work while self-directed should not interfere with feature work, but should inform that work such that it is done in the best way possible. (i.e. balancing time, technology, extensibility, etc.)

##### How to Create A Guild

- Create a new markdown document at `./handbook/${NAME}_guild.md`:
  - meeting notes
  - to record mission statement
- Set up a public channel in slack (e.g. `#guild-database`) to gauge interest
- If there is interest, meet to:
  - elect a leader
  - ratify mission statement
  - establish meeting cadence
  - create tickets to contribute to the backlog

##### How to Run a Guild

- Guilds are not mandatory - but should strive to add as much value as possible
- Meeting notes should be taken in case people could not attend
- Wiki can be setup under guardian for guild notes
- Public slack channels for additional discussion: guild-XXX
- Guild outputs/action items should be created and prioritized by the team through normal card creation flow (product-end for engineering)
- Guilds SHOULD encourage outside-of-engineering participation
- Guilds should have a mission
- Guilds should self elect a facilitator, and should be ok with switching that around periodically. (perhaps establish a term period in your first meeting)

##### Meeting Cadence

- 1 every week - 30 minutes max
- 1 every other week - 60 minutes max
- 1 every month - 90 minutes max

## People

Engineering is composed of two teams and its leadership corps.

### Leadership

| Name          | Role                      | Handle                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| XXX           | SVP                       | [@xxx](https://github.com/xxx)                         |
| XXX           | VP                        | [@xxx](https://github.com/xxx)                         |
| XXX           | Director                  | [@xxx](https://github.com/xxx)                         |

### Roles

- [Agile Facilitators](./handbook/role_agile_facilitator.md)

### Processes

#### Daily Stand-up

#### Defining Work

##### Project Discovery

The discovery process should be used when we have a major idea that needs to be researched and discussed. Often there is some kind of a bigger picture outcome, but there aren't enough details to start writing tickets.

Simple examples:

- Make the onboarding process better
- Revamp our APIs
- Make cloud connectors into first class citizens

###### Audience

The audience of a discovery process should include representation from as many people from around the company as needed to correctly identify the business problem needing to be adressed, focus on a specific set of outcomes, and prioritize wants vs needs.

An engineer from at least 2 teams should be assigned as a lead for discovery projects to encourage communication to ensure multiple viewpoints

##### Project Kick-Offs

Project kickoffs should occur after a focused outcome to a business problem has been identified, but needs implimentation details discussed by the engineering group.

###### Project Kick Off

A team should own a PKO. At least one member from other teams should be invited during PKO's to encourage communiation.

##### Horse Trading

#### Allocating Work

##### Grooming

##### Refinement

##### Picking up tickets

#### Releasing Work

Our latest release processes are codified in our [Release Process RFC](./rfcs/004-release-process.md)

## Technology

- Our primary language is [Golang](./handbook/go.md), and should be the default when creating a new project
- We host all services and infrastructure on [Google Cloud Platform - GCP](#)
- We manage our [Infrastructure](./handbook/infrastructure.md) using [Terraform](./handbook/terraform.md)
- All telemetry (logs and metrics) are aggregated in [Prometheus](./handbook/telemetry.md) and [Grafana](./handbook/telemetry.md)
- Architectural diagrams are drawn using [Miro](./handbook/miro.md)

### Systems and Services

You can find an up to date list of the tools and services we maintain in our [service catalog](./handbook/service_catalog.md) and our [automation list](./handbook/automations.md).

### Practices

- [Creating new services](./handbook/service_setup.md)
- [Proposing & Reviewing Changes](./rfcs/005-code-review-guidelines)
- [On-call checklist](./handbook/on_call.md)
- [Using your training budget](./handbook/training.md)

### Vendors

To see all vendors - check out the [Vendors](#) section of the handbook

### Quality and Standards

Engineering runs an RFC (request for comment) process to discuss and ratify standards proposed by our team members. Right now our RFCs are organization-wide, meaning _all_ teams must abide by them.

Our RFC process itself is under development, and an RFC for our RFC process will be coming shortly.

Full list of RFCs can be found in the [RFCs](#) section of the handbook

#### Examples:

- [HTTP API design](./rfcs/001-http-api-standard.md)
- [Queueing contracts](./rfcs/002-messaging-standard.md)
- [CI best practices](./rfcs/003-ci-best-practices.md)
- [How we release code](./rfcs/004-release-process.md)

## Runbooks and Playbooks

We maintain a number of runbooks for common issues and service requests.

#### Examples:

Full list can be found in the in the [Runbooks](#) and [Playbooks](#) section of the handbook

- [Gathering "daily-deltas" for a customer](./runbooks/daily_deltas_requests.md)
- [Deleting data for a customer](./runbooks/delete_requests.md)
- [Setting CI up for a new repo](./runbooks/new-circleci-project-setup.md)
- [Monitoring our docker container platform](./runbooks/platform_mk_iii.md)
- [Emptying RabbitMQ queues](./runbooks/purge_rabbitmq_queues.md)
- [Shutting down scanning by request](./runbooks/stop-scanning-requests.md)
- [Creating docker hub repos](./runbooks/creating_docker_repos.md)

## Training

### Required

### Recommended

### Training Budget

Engineering employees are all assigned a training budget of XXX$ USD per year.

Check your contract as to when this should be made available to you (it should usually be about 90 days after hire)

#### How to use it

Your training budget can be used for work related things like books, special events (conventions), and certifications. To use it:
