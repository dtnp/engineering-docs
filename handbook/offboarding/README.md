# Offboarding

Offboarding is the process that leads to the formal separation between an employee and a company through resignation, termination, or retirement. It encompasses all the decisions and processes that take place when an employee leaves. This may include:

- Transferring that employeeâ€™s job responsibilities
- Deactivating access rights and passwords
- Turning in equipment
- Conducting exit interviews to gather feedback

# Checklist

To simplify the process, and to separate the different offboarding requirements, a ticket should be created following the [Offboarding Checklist](/handbook/offboarding/checklist.md)
