# Common Meetings

*NOTE: This should be links to the agile folder with more detailed explanations of the meetings

## Standup

Daily standups.  

Standups should focus on Impediments, not just Blockers, and interesting new information - they should not be a "general update"

### Async Slack Updates

1. Post what you generally worked on today - usually somewhere in the last hour of your day
1. No need to call out “tomorrow” - unless there is something specific you wanted people to know — examples might be: vacation, training, bug ticket that you want to take a swing at, etc.
1. It’s great to show the ticket number, and even better to link to the ticket.  But please put at least a few words about what the ticket is (or just copy paste the title).  Additionally, a tiny blurb about what specifically you did WITH that ticket would be great.  Examples:
    - Good: DB-6334 - bug - no live branch when importing existing repo
    - Better: (Bug) https://getpantheon.atlassian.net/browse/DB-6332 — no live branch when importing existing repo
    - Best: (Bug) BD-6332 - “When importing an existing decoupled repo, no live branch created in multidevenv datastore” — Initial investigation.  I could NOT recreate and could use some help
1. Reason for #3 - The goal is for someone to quickly look over these and know what is happening — WITHOUT having to ask someone in person (like in a zoom/slack video call)!  This also helps:
    - YOU when you have to search on what you previously worked on an in week or two from now (rarely happens - but it does happen :smiley: ) — having key words to search when you can’t remember the ticket number is GREAT
    - Product / Project - Lets them quickly see what is happening and not having to ask/message you all about details
    - It’s a quick way to call out IMPEDIMENTS (i’ll talk about this with you all later) — Impediments: things that SLOW you down (not just blockers)
    - Your team mates!  Sometimes, someone is out on vacation, training, working on bugs, doctors, etc, etc.  This is a GREAT way to come back after a few days off and get a quick idea of what happened!

No need to get super descriptive.  Most of what is see above is pretty good - but adding in that few extra words helps alot.
Final point —

### Async Standup Overlap

Standups!  When standup happens - it’s 100% ok to say “decoupled-standup has my update - no new details” if there is nothing new to add!  :1000000:  That actually keeps the standups moving along faster!  The goal is not to repeat your entire update, but to allow standups to be a place where we discuss upcoming changes, impediments, blockers, and issues… And Celebrating Successes!! (edited) 

## Weekly Kick Off

These happen on Mondays at 12:30pm ET

## Engineering Monthly

TBD

## Team Refinement

The team looks over new tickets to make sure they are details enough with clear and concise outcomes needed to complete

## Retrospectives

Time to discuss how to make the team more efficient, effective, and overall better.

## Sprint Planning
