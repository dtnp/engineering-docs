# Role Overview
**Agile Facilitation** is the "art" (an informed blend of techniques and insight) of aiding groups to work collaboratively, identifying the most valuable path forward, and ultimately increase the teamâ€™s productivity.

From a continuous improvement perspective, we know that having clear and attainable goals, both set and agreed on by those doing the work, is a fundamental factor in both motivation and team success. Coupled with the short cycles of Scrum/Kanban, this provides an excellent mechanism for teams to improve incrementally while responding to changing conditions.

# Role Requirements:
1. Facilitate agile ceremonies
1. Ensure that there is a backlog of tickets ready 2 sprints out (about 1 month worth of work)
1. Look for and discuss team inefficiencies, impediments, and issues
1. Coordinate organizational process improvements with management, and other agile facilitators
1. Assist in discussions to ensure that the roadmap has at least 4 sprints of projects identified (about 2 months worth of work)
1. Ensure that all tickets are labeled correctly for reporting and tracking purposes

## Metrics

The following are a list of metrics the agile facilitators should be aiming to achieve in collaboration with their teams:

- Support 1 month worth of refined tickets/epics
- Healthy Backlog - Weekly cleanup/updates to the teams roadmaps
- Usage and understanding of the Release Report - for better forecasting
- Usage and understanding of the Burndown Report - for better forecasting
- Aid management in supporting 2 months worth of projects towards roadmaps

[ [top](#top) ]

## Ownership

Agile facilitators should put time aside from engineering tasks to keep a healthy backlog, correct their teams direction and keep roadmaps up to date.  The agile facilitator is responsible for making sure the team maintains proper agile methodologies.  Often, the agile facilitator manages growth of the engineering team, project workload, scale requirements, deadlines, and organizational change that all put pressure on engineers to move quickly.

## Implicit Communication

As a agile facilitator, communication both in and out of team is crucial.  Communication becomes more challenging as the organization continues to scale. Remote work compounds this problem.  To combat this issue, agile facilitators should share cross-team standards and conventions to create forms of communication that do not require additional in-person time spent explaining details. It is up to the agile facilitators to establish as many of these conventions as possible to maximize implicit communication.

## Empirical Evidence

A agile facilitator needs to be able to be able to properly estimate the work their teams are doing, as well as spot inefficiencies.  Additionally, a agile facilitator should have a solid understanding of the time spent per sprint on bugs and unscheduled work.  Team reporting, proper use of labels, retros, and open-communication are all aspects to understand a teams health.

# Agile Ceremonies 
The following is a list of agile ceremonies with an overview of expectation from those ceremonies


## Daily Standups

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- What impediments are slowing you down

- The team should strive to make sure the standup meetings are moving along
	- Keep to important details
	- Parking lot 16th minute conversations not directly useful for all people on the team
	- Keep updates less than 60 seconds (that's a GOAL, not a requirement)
- Don't add needless details:
	- It's perfectly OK to say: "Worked on X yesterday, same today - need heads down time, no impediments"
- After everyone's updates are done:
	- ASK about impediments again - hearing other peoples updates might remind someone of an issue
	- ASK about any additional or known unscheduled work

[ [top](#top) ]

-----

## New Sprint

- Ask about vacation / downtime / "not available" time - (company vacations, personal, dentist time, traveling, new video game)
- Ask about needed "heads down" time to finish important/difficult tasks (potentially take on less this sprint)
- Check velocity: keep or beat this number (optimize each sprint to get a LITTLE better every time)
- Discuss dependencies and impediments/roadblocks (other teams, management, sale of new tools, etc)
- Answer the question: "Does every individual have enough things to work on this sprint"
- Last 2 days of sprint - Team members should not start new tickets if some are still open
	- Help others finish tickets and break through impediments for the end of the sprint!
	- The TEAM is trying to complete tickets together, not individually

## Backlog Refinement
- **Value Driven Sprints**: What of value is gained from these projects, and tickets
- Point together - point poker? https://tools.wmflabs.org/hatjitsu/
- Determine Dependencies
- Make sure to call out any obstacles - no matter how small
- Make sure to plan with whole team, not alone or with PO
- Make sure to have SOME goals 2 sprints out (even if they change)
- Make sure that ALL EMPLOYEES have tasks to do (not just a number of tickets)
	- Use Assignments
	- Check assignments and make sure 1 person doesn't have 80% of the work

[ [top](#top) ]

-----

## Retrospects
[Example Miro Retro Template](#)
- "How to become more effective" - not a rant sessions
- What did we want to accomplish last time
- Did we meet / beat our goals - why, why not (seek/offer solutions)
- What could be better
- What was good
- Future Notes
- Anything to share with other teams


[ [top](#top) ]

## Project Kick-Offs

- All projects should have a spike 3 or 4 sprints before the project starts on the roadmap
- Project kick-offs no longer than 1 hour long by default
- Things to identify, discuss, and focus on:
	- Understanding the key objectives required for the project
	- Understanding the timeline budget
	- Minimum requirements for success
	- Architectural changes NEEDED for sustainability, scale, and growth needs
	- Architectural changes wanted
- Tickets needing to be created should be identified in the individual epics within the project
	- Ticket creation should be assigned an owner during this meeting
	- Ticket creation should be split across the team (multiple people on a ticket is OK!)

[ [top](#top) ]

## Epic Spikes

- All epics should have a spike 3 or 4 sprints before the epic starts on the roadmap
- Project spikes should be 30 minutes long by default
- Things to identify, discuss, and focus on:
	- Understanding the key objectives required for the epic
	- Understanding the timeline budget
	- Minimum requirements for success
	- Architectural changes NEEDED for sustainability, scale, and growth needs
	- Architectural changes wanted
