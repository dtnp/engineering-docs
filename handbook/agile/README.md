# Agile Overview

The Agile methodology is a collection of principles that value adaptability and flexibility. Agile aims to provide better responsiveness to changing business needs and therefore focuses on enabling teams to deliver in workable increments.

## Principles

- **Implicit Communication**: Common conventions and patterns should be used to make information simple to consume without needing to ask for help
- **Minimized Decision Paralysis**: Every engineer should know what to do next, be confident with the ticket details, and know who to ask for additional detail
- **Fail Fast**: Starting work on a project, immediately gathering feedback, and then determining whether to continue working on that task or take a different approach -- Adapt
- **Feedback**: Process should exist to simplify mental load and create recognizable patterns.  Feedback is required to ensure that process continues to make things easier, not more complex.
- **Trust**: Engineers should self organize and create the tools they understand the goals and create their own path to reach them.
- **Adapt**: Engineers must tune and adjust the process continually, following the KISS or "Keep It Simple Stupid" principle
