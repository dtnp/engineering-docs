# On-Call Rotation

The entire engineering teams is on call to handle first-level issues.  Tooling should be in place to help identify issues and their severity.  

In the event that runbooks do not cover a given situation, and DevOps is unable to patch a critical situation, Developers are contacted to fix the issues that arise.  **"You build it, you own it."**


## Runbooks

Common issues should be documented via [Runbooks](#) (TODO: Transfer to Handbook) to ensure that as many situations as possible can be handled via well-written documentation. 

## Swapping Weeks

[Team Schedule](#) -- PAgerduty

Sometimes the people on call need to change weeks with someone else due to vacation or life events.  That's ok!  Work with your team mates and see if someone is willing to swap with you!
