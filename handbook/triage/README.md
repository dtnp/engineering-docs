# Triage

"A process in which things are ranked in terms of importance or priority"

The engineering triage process is used to capture bug, service requests, and general questions from outside of engineering.

## Philosophy

1. All communication must flow through tickets -- **if it's not in a ticket, it does not get done**
2. The Triage board is to be highly visible (All of Pantheon) to allow internal customers to track all incidents
3. The Triage board should **NOT** track code defects from tickets still open and assigned to teams
4. Developers should be part of the triage process -- "You break it, you fix it"
5. The work on the Triage board should be regularly reviewed and prioritized
6. The Triage board should minimize noise by using consistent labels for filtering against
7. Runbooks should be created and promoted wherever applicable
8. **If we all do a little, we gain a lot!**

## Triage Board

TBD

## Github vs ZenHub

Lots in Pantheon do **NOT** has access to [GitHub](/handbook/3rd_party_tools/github.md)

When sending ticket information to someone, or when linking things in documentation for company employees to see, please link the [Jira](/handbook/3rd_party_tools/jira.md) ticket and verify that they can see the details
