# Synopsis
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for guilds.  Guilds are self-governing, cross-team groups formed to foster standards, knowledge sharing and improve outcomes in specific areas that are germane to the technical development of the product(s).  (Interest group that is trying to improve something.)

This work while self-directed should not interfere with feature work, but should inform that work such that it is done in the best way possible.  (I.e. balancing time, technology, extensibility, etc.)

# How to Create A Guild
- Set up a confluence page for:
  - meeting notes
  - to record mission statement 
- Set up a public channel in slack (e.g. guild-database) to gauge interest
- If there is interest, meet to:
  - elect a leader 
  - ratify mission statement
  - establish meeting cadence
  - create tickets to contribute to the backlog
 
# How to Run a Guild
- Guilds are not mandatory - but should strive to add as much value as possible
- Meeting notes should be taken in case people could not attend
- Wiki can be setup under guardian for guild notes
- Public slack channels for additional discussion: guild-XXX
- Guild outputs/action items should be created and prioritized by the team through normal card creation flow (product-end for engineering)
- Guilds SHOULD encourage outside-of-engineering participation
- Guilds should have a mission
- Guilds should self elect a facilitator, and should be ok with switching that around periodically. (perhaps establish a term period in your first meeting)

### Meeting Cadence Options
- 1 every week - 30 minutes max
- 1 every other week - 60 minutes max
- 1 every month - 90 minutes max
